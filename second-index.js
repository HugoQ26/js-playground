// You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second 
// occurrence of the second string in the first one.

// Let's go through the first example where you need to find the 
// second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to find its 
// first occurrence with a function indexOf which will point out that 
// "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of 
// the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which 
// is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second 
// occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

// Input: Two strings.

// Output: Int or undefined


function secondIndex(text, symbol) {
    // returns the second index of a symbol in a given text
    
    let index = text.indexOf(symbol);
    let index2 = text.indexOf(symbol, index+1);
    
    
    if(text.includes(symbol)) {
        if(index2 != -1) {
            return index2;
        } else {
            return undefined;
        }
    } else {
        return undefined;
    }
