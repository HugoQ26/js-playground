// Let's work with numbers.

// You are given an array of numbers (floats). You should find the 
// difference between the maximum and minimum element. Your function 
// should be able to handle an undefined amount of arguments. For an 
// empty argument list, the function should return 0.

// Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 
// 2 (binary) fractions. So we should check the result with Â±0.001 
// precision.
// Think about how to work with an arbitrary number of arguments.

// Input: An arbitrary number of arguments as numbers (int, float).

// Output: The difference between maximum and minimum as a number 
// (int, float).
